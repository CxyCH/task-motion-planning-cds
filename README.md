# task_motion_planning_cds
This repository includes the packages and instructions to run the LASA Motion planning architecture developed initially for the rolling task within the Robohow project, but can be used for any task and any type of controller, it only has to output the desired command task spacce (i.e. desired cartesian pose/ft/stiffness)

This research was conducted in the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of Prof. Aude Billard.  ---- http://lasa.epfl.ch/

It was funded by the EU Project ROBOHOW.COG. ----https://robohow.eu/
